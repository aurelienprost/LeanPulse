# SyD
The LeanPulse System Documents generator (SyD) is a powerful tool enabling easy and fast generation of rich PDF documents from your Simulink® and Xcos models.

## How to build
Directly clone this repository in Eclipse 4.3 or above and then run **SyD-build-setup.launch** to automatically build a Windows installer.

The build process is implemented with Ant scripts and may **requires additional software and configuration** to execute correctly. Please refer to the various *build.xml* files of the project to learn more about the prerequisites.

You can also have a look at the other **.launch* files (including in the sub-folders) to easily perform debugging or unit-testing tasks.

## Enjoy !
